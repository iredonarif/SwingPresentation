# SwingPresentation
Course module to present the Java swing library to my classmates (L3).

I prepared this course at the begining of my third year of computer science.
The goal is to introduce swing to my classmates and make them understand how it works through practice.

The repository include:
	
- a course file (pdf) that explains step by step how to learn & understand swing components;
- an UML class diagram that shows the relation between some swing components;
- two pratical classes
